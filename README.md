# HTML and CSS

HTML and CSS are important because they are the building blocks of the web. HTML is used to structure the content of a website, while CSS is used to control the appearance of that content. Together, they allow developers to create websites that are accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

As a way of practicing what I've learn, i've built my Resume page, its simple but I loved it, I've a long way to go in my web dev journey, but its a nice start.
